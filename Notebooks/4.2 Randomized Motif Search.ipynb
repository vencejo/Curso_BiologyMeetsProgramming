    "### Rolling dice to find motifs\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now turn to **randomized algorithms** that flip coins and roll dice in order to search for motifs. Making random algorithmic decisions may sound like a disastrous idea — just imagine a chess game in which every move would be decided by rolling a die. However, an 18th Century French mathematician and naturalist, Comte de Buffon, first proved that randomized algorithms are useful by randomly dropping needles onto parallel strips of wood and using the results of this experiment to accurately approximate the constant π (see DETOUR: Buffon’s Needle). \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized algorithms may be nonintuitive because they lack the control of traditional algorithms. Some randomized algorithms are ** Las Vegas algorithms **, which deliver solutions that are guaranteed to be exact, despite the fact that they rely on making random decisions. Yet most randomized algorithms, including the motif finding algorithms that we will consider in this chapter, are **Monte Carlo algorithms**. These algorithms are not guaranteed to return exact solutions, but they do quickly find approximate solutions. Because of their speed, they can be run many times, allowing us to choose the best approximation from thousands of runs.\n",

    "Simulating the process of generating a random integer is more difficult than you might think and requires more mathematics than we would like to describe here.
