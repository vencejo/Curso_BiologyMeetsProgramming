    "A straightforward algorithm for finding the most frequent words in a string Text computes how many times each k-mer substring of Text appears in Text, then selects the k-mers occurring the most. To implement this algorithm, called FrequentWords, we will need to generate an array (i.e., a one-row table) denoted Count, where Count[i] is the number of times that the i-th k-mer of Text appears in Text. That is, Count[i] stores PatternCount(Pattern, Text) for Pattern = Text[i:i+k] (figure below).\n",

    "Arrays can be represented in Python using a data structure called a dictionary (often abbreviated as dict).

Learn more about how to work with dictionaries in the following set of exercises.\n",

    " ** Python Practice: Complete the “Python Lists and Dictionaries” lesson (14 exercises) in Unit 5 on Codecademy. **\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how to work with dictionaries, we can write a Python function that takes a string Text and an integer k as input and returns the Count dictionary for k-mers in Text. The code below uses the notation Count = {} to initialize a blank dictionary containing no items. It also uses PatternCount as a subroutine, or a function that is called within another function. Subroutines are vital to programming because they allow us to reuse code without needing to copy it multiple times.\n",

    "To identify the most frequent k-mers in Text, we simply need to find the maximum value of the Count dictionary. Python has a built-in function called values() that returns a list containing the values of a dictionary. You have already learned about lists in the preceding Python Practice; we can therefore compute the maximum of all values in a given list using the following function. (This function uses the form of the for loop for ranging over the items in a list that we learned in the last Python Practice.)\n",

    "Now that we know how to find the maximum value of Count, we just need to use a for loop to pass through Count and find each index i such that Count[i] is maximized.
