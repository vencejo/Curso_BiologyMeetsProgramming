    "### What is the probability that the sun will not rise tomorrow?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1650, after the Scots proclaimed Charles II as king during the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell made a famous appeal to the Church of Scotland. Urging them to see the error of their royal alliance, he pleaded,\n",
    "\n",
    "    I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible that you may be mistaken.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scots rejected the appeal, and Cromwell invaded Scotland in response. His quotation later inspired the statistical maxim called Cromwell’s rule, which states that we should not use probabilities of 0 or 1 unless we are talking about logical statements that can only be true or false. In other words, we should allow a small probability for extremely unlikely events, such as “this book was written by aliens” or “the sun will not rise tomorrow”. We cannot speak to the likelihood of the former event, but in the 18th Century, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace actually estimated the probability that the sun will not rise tomorrow (1/1826251), given that it has risen every day for the past 5000 years. Although this estimate was ridiculed by his contemporaries, Laplace’s approach to this question now plays an important role in statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any observed data set, there is the possibility, especially with low-probability events or small data sets, that an event with nonzero probability does not occur. Its observed frequency is therefore zero; however, setting the empirical probability of the event equal to zero represents an inaccurate oversimplification that may cause problems. By artificially adjusting the probability of rare events, these problems can be mitigated.\n"

    "In order to improve this unfair scoring, bioinformaticians often substitute zeroes with small numbers called pseudocounts. The simplest approach to introducing pseudocounts, called Laplace’s Rule of Succession, is similar to the principle that Laplace used to calculate the probability that the sun will not rise tomorrow. In the case of motifs, pseudocounts often amount to adding 1 (or some other small number) to each element of Count(Motifs). For example, say that we have the following motif, count, and profile matrices:\n",
